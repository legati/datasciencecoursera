## Description

Here is an interactive plot made using **plotly** based on data from the dataset **quakes**.
The data set give the locations of 1000 seismic events of MB > 4.0. The events occurred in a cube near Fiji since 1964.

The plot demonstrates the relation between the earthquake depth and its Richter Magnitude.

## Slide with R Output
Here is the takeout from the dataset, which demonstrates how the data is organised.
```{r quakes, echo = TRUE}
head(quakes, 10)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(plotly))
suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))
g <- ggplot(quakes, aes(x = depth, y = mag)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle('Relation between earthquake magnitude and depth')
ggplotly(g)

```
