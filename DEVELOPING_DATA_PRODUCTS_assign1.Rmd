```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Intro
Here is an interactive map made using **leaflet** based on data from the dataset **quakes**.
The data set give the locations of 1000 seismic events of MB > 4.0. The events occurred in a cube near Fiji since 1964.

Here is the takeout from the dataset, which demonstrates how the data is organised.
```{r quakes}
head(quakes, 10)
```

## Leaflet

Here is the map of the first 10 earthquake centre locations:

```{r leaflet, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(leaflet))
data(quakes)
#locations <- quakes[1:10,c(1,2)]
map1 <- leaflet(data = quakes[1:10,]) %>% 
        addTiles() %>%
        addCircleMarkers(~long, ~lat, 
                         popup = ~as.character(mag))
map1
```
